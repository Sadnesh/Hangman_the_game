# Hangman Game

## Description
Hangman is a classic word guessing game where one player thinks of a word, and the other player tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. For every incorrect guess, a part of a hangman is drawn. The game ends when the player guesses the word correctly or when the hangman is fully drawn.

This project is a simple implementation of the Hangman game in Python.
